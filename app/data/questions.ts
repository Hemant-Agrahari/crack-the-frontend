    question: "What is the use of doctype in HTML?",
    answer:
      "The <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML is used to tell the browser which version of HTML the page is written in. It's not an HTML tag, but an instruction for the browser. In modern web development, we usually write <!DOCTYPE html> which indicates HTML5. Its main purpose is to ensure the browser renders the page in standards mode instead of quirks mode. Standards mode follows the official HTML and CSS specifications, while quirks mode tries to emulate old, non-standard behavior for legacy pages. By declaring the doctype, we make sure our page is interpreted consistently across different browsers, which improves compatibility and prevents unexpected layout or styling issues.",

    question:
      "What is the difference between async and defer in JavaScript script loading?",
    answer:
      "async and defer are script attributes that control how external JavaScript files are loaded and executed in the browser. Both allow the script to download in parallel while the HTML is still being parsed, but they behave very differently when it comes to execution. When a script uses async, it starts downloading in the background and executes as soon as the download finishes, even if the HTML parsing is still in progress. Because of this, the execution order is not guaranteed, and async is usually used for scripts that work independently, such as analytics or tracking code. On the other hand, defer also downloads the script in parallel, but it waits to execute until the entire HTML document has been fully parsed. This ensures that scripts execute in the same order they appear in the page, making defer the better choice for scripts that depend on DOM elements or rely on a specific execution sequence. In simple terms, async runs the moment it’s ready, while defer waits for the HTML to finish loading before running.",

    question:

    answer:
      "CSS files should always be placed in the <head> using <link>. Reason: CSS is needed to style the page before it's rendered. If it's loaded late, the user might see an unstyled or 'flashy' page (FOUC - Flash of Unstyled Content). JavaScript files are usually placed at the end of the <body> or loaded with defer/async. Reason: JavaScript can block HTML parsing. If scripts are in the <head> without defer/async, they delay page rendering. Placing them at the end allows the HTML to load first, improving page performance.",

    answer:
      "The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how every HTML element is structured and how space is calculated on a webpage. Every element is treated as a rectangular box consisting of four layers.\n\n🔵 Layers of the Box Model:\n1. Content → The actual text or image inside the box.\n2. Padding → Space around the content (inside the box).\n3. Border → The line surrounding the padding and content.\n4. Margin → Space outside the border, separating the element from others.\n\n🟣 Visual Representation:\n[ Margin ]\n  [ Border ]\n    [ Padding ]\n      [ Content ]\n\n🟡 Example:\n.box {\n  width: 200px;\n  padding: 10px;\n  border: 2px solid black;\n  margin: 20px;\n}\n\nTotal width = content + padding + border + margin\nTotal width = 200 + 20 + 4 + 40 = 264px\n\nIn short: The CSS Box Model explains how size and spacing of elements are calculated using content, padding, border, and margin.",

    question: "What is position in CSS?",
    answer:
      "position in CSS is a property that controls how an element is placed on the page.\n\nIt decides whether the element follows the normal document flow or if it can be moved freely using top, left, right, and bottom.\n\nWe mainly use the position property when we want custom layouts, overlays, sticky headers, tooltips, popups, etc.\n\n🔵 How many types of positions are there in CSS?\n\nCSS has 5 types of positioning:\n\n1️⃣ Static Positioning (default)\n\nStatic is the normal flow of the page.\n\nThe browser places the element naturally without any special positioning.\n\nTop/left/bottom/right do not work here.\n\nWe mostly leave elements static unless we need custom placement.\n\n2️⃣ Relative Positioning\n\nA relatively positioned element stays in the normal flow, but we can shift it using top/left/bottom/right.\n\nThe important thing is: it moves relative to its original position, and it still occupies its original space.\n\nWe commonly use position: relative to create a positioning context for absolutely positioned child elements.\n\n3️⃣ Absolute Positioning\n\nAn absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal flow and does not occupy space.\n\nIt positions itself relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., parent with position: relative/absolute/fixed).\n\nIf no positioned parent exists, it positions relative to the viewport/document.\n\nWe use it when we want to place elements precisely — like tooltips, dropdowns, badges, etc.\n\n4️⃣ Fixed Positioning\n\nFixed works similar to absolute (removed from normal flow), but the reference point is always the viewport, not the parent.\n\nThe element stays fixed even when the page scrolls.\n\nCommon use cases: sticky headers, floating buttons, side menus, chat widgets.\n\n5️⃣ Sticky Positioning\n\nSticky positioning is like a mix of relative and fixed behavior. When the page first loads, the element behaves normally, just like a relatively positioned element. It sits in the flow and doesn't act special. But the moment you start scrolling and reach the position you've set—like top: 0—the element \"sticks\" to that spot and stays visible, just like a fixed element. This makes it perfect for things like sticky headers or table headers that you want to remain visible only after the user scrolls past them, not from the very beginning.",

    question:
      "What is the difference between getElementById and getElementsByClassName?",
    answer:
      "getElementById returns a single DOM element whose id matches the given string. Since IDs are unique in HTML, this method always returns one element or null if no match is found. It is also one of the fastest DOM selection methods.\n\ngetElementsByClassName returns a live HTMLCollection of all elements that have the specified class name. Even if only one element matches, it still returns a collection. If no elements match, it returns an empty collection. You can loop through it to access each element.\n\nIn short: getElementById → returns one unique element, getElementsByClassName → returns a live collection of multiple elements.",

    question: "What is Flexbox in CSS?",
    answer:
      "Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout system designed to align, distribute, and position elements easily inside a container. It helps build responsive layouts without using floats or complex positioning.\n\n🔵 How Flexbox Works:\nFlexbox has two main parts:\n1. Flex Container → The parent element (display: flex)\n2. Flex Items → The children inside the container\n\n🟣 Common Flexbox Properties:\nOn the Container:\n- display: flex → Activates flexbox\n- flex-direction → row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse\n- justify-content → Aligns items horizontally (center, space-between, space-around)\n- align-items → Aligns items vertically (center, flex-start, flex-end)\n- flex-wrap → Wrap items onto multiple lines\n\nOn the Items:\n- flex-grow → How much an item expands\n- flex-shrink → How much an item shrinks\n- flex-basis → Initial size of item\n- align-self → Align a single item\n\n🟡 Example:\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n🟠 Why Flexbox Is Useful:\n- Easy horizontal & vertical centering\n- Smooth responsive design\n- Flexible spacing between elements\n- No need for floats or complicated CSS\n\nIn short: Flexbox is a powerful layout system that helps align and position elements easily in both directions and makes responsive design much simpler.",

Instead of writing all three properties separately, flex lets you define how an item grows, shrinks, and what its initial size should be.\n\n🔵 Syntax:\nflex: <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>;\n\n🟣 Example:\nflex: 1 0 200px;\nHere,\n- flex-grow: 1 → Item can grow if space is available.\n- flex-shrink: 0 → Item will not shrink.\n- flex-basis: 200px → Initial size is 200px.\n\n🟡 Common Shorthands:\n1. flex: 1;\n   → flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0\n\n2. flex: 0 1 auto;\n   → Default behavior (item shrinks but does not grow)\n\n3. flex: 1 1 auto;\n   → Item grows and shrinks based on available space\n\n🟠 Why Flex Shorthand Is Useful:\n- Makes code shorter and cleaner\n- Controls item resizing behavior quickly\n- Helps build responsive layouts easily\n\nIn short: flex shorthand sets grow, shrink, and basis in one line, controlling how flex items expand or shrink inside a flex container.",

    answer:
      "px, em, rem, and % are CSS units used to define sizes, but they behave differently based on how they scale.\n\n🔵 px (Pixels):\n- Absolute unit.\n- Does NOT scale based on parent or root.\n- Fixed size.\n- Good for borders, 1px lines, icons.\n\nExample: font-size: 16px;\n\n🟣 em:\n- Relative unit.\n- Depends on the **font-size of the parent element**.\n- 1em = parent's font-size.\n- Can compound (nested em values keep multiplying).\n\nExample:\n.parent { font-size: 20px; }\n.child { font-size: 2em; } → 40px\n\n🟡 rem:\n- Relative unit.\n- Depends on the **root (html) font-size**, not the parent.\n- Default root is 16px → 1rem = 16px.\n- More predictable than em.\n\nExample:\nhtml { font-size: 10px; }\n.box { font-size: 2rem; } → 20px\n\n🟠 % (Percentage):\n- Relative to the parent element.\n- Used for widths, heights, padding, etc.\n\nExample:\n.container { width: 100%; }\n.child { width: 50%; }\n\n🟣 Key Difference:\n- px → fixed size\n- em → relative to parent\n- rem → relative to root\n- % → relative to parent size\n\nIn short: Use rem for consistent scaling, em for flexible nested scaling, px for fixed values, and % for responsive layouts.",

      "CSS Grid and Flexbox are both powerful layout systems, but they solve different kinds of problems. Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, meaning it handles rows and columns at the same time. It's perfect when you need full control over both directions — like building a full page layout, a dashboard, or a gallery where items should align both horizontally and vertically. Grid lets you create structured layouts with precise placement.\n\nFlexbox, on the other hand, is one-dimensional. It either arranges items in a row or a column, but not both at the same time. Flexbox shines when we're dealing with smaller components and want content to adjust naturally — like navbars, buttons, cards, or aligning items inside a container. It's more content-driven, meaning items automatically take up space based on their size and available room.",

    question: "What is JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that enables interactive and responsive behavior on the web. It runs directly in the browser and allows developers to update the UI in real time, handle user actions, communicate with servers, and manage application logic without requiring a page reload. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved into a powerful ecosystem that supports modern development patterns, including functional, object-oriented, and asynchronous programming using promises and async/await. With its ability to manipulate the DOM, interact with APIs, and run both on the client and server through technologies like Node.js, JavaScript has become the backbone of modern web applications. For example, a simple line like console.log('Hello JavaScript') immediately executes in the browser console, showing how quickly the language responds. In essence, JavaScript is the core language that drives dynamic user experiences and powers everything from small UI interactions to full-scale single-page applications.",

    answer:
      "Web Workers are a way to run JavaScript code in the background, on a separate thread, so that heavy tasks don't block the main UI thread. Normally, JavaScript is single-threaded, which means if we do something expensive — like large calculations, data processing, or image manipulation — the UI can freeze. Web Workers solve this by giving us a background worker thread that handles the heavy work while the main thread stays free to keep the page smooth and responsive.\n\n\n\nThe main point is that Web Workers don't have access to the DOM; they communicate with the main thread using messages. They're especially useful for things like data-heavy operations, real-time calculations, or anything that could make the UI lag.",

    answer:
      "A global variable in JavaScript can be created in a few different ways depending on how the code is written. If you assign a value to a variable without using var, let, or const, JavaScript automatically creates it as a global variable, although this approach is considered unsafe because it can cause accidental overwrites. When you use var at the top level, outside of any function, the variable also becomes global and is attached to the window object in the browser. Another way is to explicitly add a property to the global object, such as window.myVar in a browser environment. You can also declare variables with let or const at the top level, which makes them global within the module, though they are not attached to the window object, making them slightly safer. In practice, relying on global variables is discouraged because they can create naming conflicts and make the application harder to maintain, so it's better to use modules or structured state management whenever possible.",

    question: "What is the 'this' keyword? Explain.",
    answer:
      "The 'this' keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is currently executing the code. What 'this' points to depends on how and where the function is called.\n\n\n\n1. In a regular function: 'this' refers to the global object (window in browsers, global in Node.js). In strict mode, it's undefined.\n\n2. In an object method: 'this' refers to the object that owns the method.\n   Example: const obj = { name: 'John', greet() { console.log(this.name); } }; obj.greet(); // 'John'\n\n3. In arrow functions: 'this' is inherited from the surrounding scope (lexical this). Arrow functions don't have their own 'this'.\n\n4. In event handlers: 'this' refers to the element that received the event.\n   Example: button.addEventListener('click', function() { console.log(this); }); // refers to button\n\n5. With call, apply, or bind: You can explicitly set what 'this' refers to.\n\n\n\nThe key thing to remember is that 'this' is determined by how a function is called, not where it's defined.",

    answer:

For example, if you click a link, the default action is to navigate to that URL. If you call preventDefault(), the navigation won't happen, but the event will still propagate (bubble up) to parent elements.\n\nExample: Preventing a form from submitting or a link from navigating.\n\n\n\nstopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements. It doesn't stop the default action — it just prevents the event from reaching other elements in the DOM tree.\n\nExample: If you click a button inside a div, and both have click handlers, calling stopPropagation() on the button prevents the div's handler from running.\n\n\n\nIn short: preventDefault() stops what the browser wants to do, while stopPropagation() stops the event from traveling to other elements.",

    question: "map, filter, reduce – Explain with example.",
    answer:
      "map: The map method transforms every element of an array and returns a new array of the same size. For example: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2); this gives [2, 4, 6, 8] because each value is multiplied by two.\n\nfilter: The filter method returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy a given condition. For instance: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); this results in [2, 4, 6] since only the even values pass the check.\n\nreduce: The reduce method takes all elements of an array and combines them into a single output value by applying a reducer function. For example: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; const sum = numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0); the final output becomes 10. In simple terms, map transforms elements, filter chooses certain elements, and reduce compresses everything into one final value.",

    question:
      "What does it mean when JavaScript is called an interpreted language?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript is considered an interpreted language because the browser's JavaScript engine reads and executes the code line by line without requiring a separate compilation step beforehand. When you write JavaScript, the engine immediately interprets and runs it during runtime, which allows the language to feel fast and flexible during development. You can write code in the browser console and see results instantly, and any changes you make reflect immediately without needing a formal compile process like languages such as C, C++, or Java. Although JavaScript is traditionally described as interpreted, modern engines actually use techniques like Just-In-Time compilation, which compiles certain parts of the code while it is running to make execution faster. Still, the overall behavior remains the same: JavaScript runs directly in the environment without requiring a separate compile step, which is why it’s described as an interpreted language.",

    question: "What does it mean that JavaScript is single-threaded?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript is considered single-threaded because it uses one call stack, meaning it can execute only one piece of code at any given moment. It processes tasks sequentially, so if one task is running, no other task can execute until it finishes. This also means that long or heavy operations, such as complex loops or large computations, can block the main thread and temporarily freeze the user interface. However, even though JavaScript itself runs in a single thread, the browser environment provides asynchronous capabilities through Web APIs, the event loop, the callback queue, and the microtask queue. These work together to allow JavaScript to handle operations like timers, network requests, and promises without stopping the main thread. So while JavaScript executes code one step at a time, its async model makes it feel non-blocking and responsive.",

    question: "What is Event Delegation in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "Event Delegation is a technique in JavaScript where instead of adding event listeners to individual child elements, we attach a single event listener to a parent element. Because events bubble up in the DOM, the parent can catch events from its children.This improves performance, reduces memory usage, and is useful when elements are created dynamically. For example, instead of adding a click event to every button inside a list, we add one click event to the list container and detect which child was clicked using event.target.\n\n Event Delegation is commonly used for lists, tables, menus, and dynamic DOM updates.",

The big advantage is that declarations are fully hoisted, meaning the entire function is moved to the top of its scope. So we can call a function declaration even before it appears in the code.\n\nA function expression is when we assign a function to a variable. Here, the variable gets hoisted but not the actual function value. This means we cannot call a function expression before it's initialized, because until that line is executed, the variable holds undefined. Function expressions are often used when we want more control, like creating anonymous functions, callbacks, or when we want to store functions inside objects.",

      "A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function remembers and has access to the variables of its outer function even after the outer function has finished executing. This happens because the inner function keeps a reference to the lexical scope in which it was created.\n\nClosures are extremely useful in JavaScript. They allow us to access outer function variables even after the function ends, which is great for creating private variables and data encapsulation. We commonly use closures in callbacks, event handlers, and functional programming patterns.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\nfunction outer() {\n  let count = 0;\n  return function inner() {\n    count++;\n    console.log(count);\n  };\n}\n\nconst counter = outer();\ncounter(); // 1\ncounter(); // 2\n\nIn this example, the inner function keeps access to the 'count' variable even after the outer function has returned. Each time we call counter(), it remembers the previous value of count and increments it. This is closure in action — the function remembers its environment.",

We typically use LocalStorage for storing things like user preferences, theme settings, or shopping cart items that should remain even after closing the browser.\n\nSessionStorage is similar to LocalStorage in terms of storage capacity (around 5MB), but the key difference is that the data is removed when the tab or window is closed. It exists only for that specific tab session. We use SessionStorage for temporary data like active tab state, form steps, or session-specific flags that should not persist across sessions.\n\nCookies are different from both LocalStorage and SessionStorage because they are sent to the server with every HTTP request.

      "What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?",
    answer:
      "Event bubbling and event capturing are two phases of event propagation in JavaScript that define the order in which events travel through the DOM.\n\nEvent bubbling is the default phase and is most commonly used in JavaScript. In this phase, the event starts from the innermost child element where the event occurred and moves upward to the outer parent elements. For example, if you click a button inside a div, the event first fires on the button, then on the div, then on its parent, and so on up to the document. The flow is: Child → Parent → Grandparent → Document. Event bubbling is particularly useful for event delegation, where we handle events on a parent element instead of attaching listeners to every child.\n\nEvent capturing, also called the trickle-down phase, works in the opposite direction. The event starts from the outermost parent element and moves inward toward the target child element. So the flow is: Document → Grandparent → Parent → Child. Event capturing is less commonly used but can be enabled by passing 'true' as the third parameter in addEventListener, like this: parent.addEventListener('click', handler, true). By default, if you pass false or omit the parameter, it uses bubbling.",

    question: "What is the difference shallow copy and deep copy?",
    answer:
      "Shallow copy and deep copy are two different ways of copying objects in JavaScript, and the main difference is how they handle nested objects or arrays.\n\nA shallow copy only copies the first level of the object. If the object contains nested objects or arrays, those nested items are not actually copied — instead, they remain referenced to the original. This means if you modify a nested object in the copied version, it will also change in the original object because both are pointing to the same nested object in memory. You can create a shallow copy using methods like the spread operator ({...obj}), Object.assign(), or Array.slice() for arrays.\n\nA deep copy, on the other hand, creates a completely independent copy of the entire object, including all nested objects and arrays. Everything is duplicated at every level, so changing anything in the copied object will not affect the original object at all. They are fully independent. To create a deep copy, we typically use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) for simple objects, or libraries like Lodash's cloneDeep() for more complex cases with functions or special types.\n\nIn simple terms: shallow copy shares nested references, while deep copy duplicates everything independently.",

The garbage collector starts from the root objects (like window, global variables).\n2. It 'marks' all objects that are reachable or still in use.\n3. Any object that is NOT reachable is considered garbage.\n4. The engine removes those unreachable objects from memory.\n\nThis prevents memory leaks by making sure unused data doesn't stay in memory forever.\n\n🔵 What makes an object 'reachable'?  \n- Variables currently in scope\n- Objects referenced by other objects\n- Active closures or event listeners\n- Global objects\n\nIf there is no reference pointing to an object, it becomes unreachable and will be collected.\n\n🔵 Example of losing reachability:\nlet user = { name: 'John' };\nuser = null; // The object is now unreachable → Garbage collected.\n\n🔵 Modern optimizations:\n- **Generational GC**: New objects are stored in a 'young' space for quick cleanup.\n- **Incremental GC**: Splits work into small steps to avoid blocking the main thread.\n- **Concurrent GC**: Runs garbage collection in parallel threads.\n- **Idle-time GC**: Runs when the browser is idle.\n\n🟡 Simple Summary:\nGarbage collection automatically removes objects that your code can no longer reach.

Instead of relying on nested callbacks, a Promise gives us an object that represents a value that we will get in the future — either the operation succeeds or it fails.\n\nA Promise starts in the pending state, and once the async work is done, it either resolves or rejects. We handle the success using .then() and handle errors using .catch(). The main advantage of Promises is that they make async flows easier to manage and help avoid callback hell. Promises are also the foundation of async/await, which makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.",

      "What is the difference between Promise.all(), Promise.race(), and Promise.allSettled()?",
    answer:
      "These Promise methods are used to handle multiple asynchronous operations together, but each behaves differently.\n\n🔵 Promise.all():\n- Runs all promises in parallel.\n- Resolves only when ALL promises resolve.\n- If ANY promise fails, the entire Promise.all() fails.\n\nExample:\nPromise.all([p1, p2, p3])\n  .then(res => console.log(res))\n  .catch(err => console.log(err));\n\n🟣 Promise.race():\n- Returns the result of the FIRST promise that settles.\n- Whichever promise resolves or rejects first wins.\n\nExample:\nPromise.race([p1, p2, p3])\n  .then(res => console.log(res))\n  .catch(err => console.log(err));\n\n🟡 Promise.allSettled():\n- Waits for ALL promises to finish.\n- Returns an array of results with status: fulfilled or rejected.\n- Never fails, even if some promises fail.\n\nExample:\nPromise.allSettled([p1, p2, p3])\n  .then(result => console.log(result));\n\n🟠 Key Difference:\n- Promise.all → Fails if one fails.\n- Promise.race → Returns whichever completes first.\n- Promise.allSettled → Returns results of all promises, regardless of success or failure.\n\nIn short: Use Promise.all for all-success situations, race for first-result scenarios, and allSettled when you need outcomes of every promise.",

    question: "What are async and await in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "Async and await are features built on top of Promises that make asynchronous code look and feel like synchronous code. When I mark a function as async, it means that the function will always return a Promise. Inside that function, I can use await to pause the execution until a Promise settles. Instead of chaining multiple .then() calls, I can write async code in a much cleaner, step-by-step style.\n\nThe main benefit is readability — especially when calling multiple APIs or performing sequential async operations. await makes the code easier to understand, handle errors using try/catch, and avoid callback hell. In simple terms, async/await helps us write asynchronous logic in a synchronous manner, but without blocking the main thread.",

    answer:

That improves readability, debugging, and makes business logic clearer, especially in larger codebases.\n\nThat said, Promises are still very useful. For example, when I need to run things in parallel using Promise.all, or when I'm working with many independent async operations, Promises are a great fit.\n\nSo my approach is:\n\nFor sequential async logic → I prefer async/await for cleaner code.\n\nFor parallel or more advanced patterns → I still use Promises directly.",

    answer:
      "The Event Loop in JavaScript is the mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks even though it runs on a single thread. JavaScript can execute only one line of code at a time, but the browser APIs and Node.js handle async work in the background. The Event Loop keeps checking if the call stack is empty, and whenever an async operation like a timer, promise, or API call finishes, the Event Loop pushes its callback back into the call stack when it's safe to run. This is what allows JavaScript to stay non-blocking and responsive, even while doing async work. Promises go to the microtask queue, timers and other callbacks go to the macrotask queue, and the Event Loop decides when each one gets executed.",

    answer:
      "In JavaScript, Debounce and Throttle are used to control high-frequency events like scroll, resize, typing, mouse move, and repeated clicks. Running a function on every event causes UI lag, too many API calls, high CPU usage, and poor user experience.\n\nDebounce — Debounce delays the execution of a function until there is a pause in the event. It runs only once after the user stops performing the action. Best use cases: search box suggestions, form validation while typing, and resize end detection. Example: When a user types a → ap → app → apple, debounce waits for 500ms and triggers only one API call.\n\nThrottle — Throttle allows a function to run at fixed time intervals even if the event fires continuously. Best use cases: scroll handling (infinite scroll, analytics), map dragging, and preventing multiple button clicks. Example: Resend OTP button — even if the user clicks 20 times, OTP sends only once in 30 seconds.\n\nIn short: Debounce waits for user inactivity before executing, while Throttle executes at fixed intervals.",

    answer:
      "When we write JavaScript code, the browser doesn't run it directly. It goes through a clear process inside the JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome).\n\n🔵 1. Reading the Code (Parsing):\nThe browser first reads the entire JavaScript file from top to bottom and checks for syntax errors. If the code is valid, it converts it into a structure called the AST — basically a format the engine understands.\n\n🔵 2. Compiling the Code:\nModern browsers use JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation. This means instead of interpreting everything line by line, they convert hot or frequently used code into machine code to make it faster.\n\n🔵 3. Executing the Code:\nAfter compilation, the code runs inside the JavaScript call stack. JavaScript is single-threaded, so it runs one task at a time.\n\n🔵 4. Handling Async Tasks:\nFor things like setTimeout, fetch, or events, the browser does not block. These tasks go to Web APIs. After they finish, their callbacks are sent to queues, and the Event Loop pushes them to the call stack when it's free.\n\n🔵 5. Memory Management:\nThe browser also manages memory — it allocates memory for variables and automatically cleans up unused objects using garbage collection.\n\n🟡 Simple Summary:\nThe browser reads the code → converts it → compiles it → runs it → handles async work with the event loop → and manages memory in the background.\n\nThis entire process happens extremely fast, which is why JavaScript feels smooth and responsive in the browser.",

This means the function receives a copy of the actual value. If we change it inside the function, it doesn't affect the original value outside.\n\nFor non-primitive types like objects and arrays, JavaScript uses call by reference. In this case, the function receives a reference to the original object, not a separate copy. So if we modify the object or array inside the function, the changes will reflect outside as well, because both the function and the outer variable point to the same memory location.",

Some common regular expression methods are:\n\n1. **test**: Tests for a match in a string\n\n2. **exec**: Executes a search for a match in a specified string\n\n3. **match**: Finds matches of a regular expression in a string\n\n4. **replace**: Replaces matched substrings with a replacement string\n\n5. **search**: Tests for a match in a string\n\n6. **split**: Splits a string into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings",

    question: "Why do we use 'use strict' in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "'use strict' enables strict mode and helps write cleaner and safer JavaScript code. It prevents accidental global variables, disallows unsafe actions, throws errors for silent failures, and makes debugging easier. For a 3-year experienced developer, it ensures more predictable and maintainable code in larger projects.",

    question: "What is the difference between SSR, SSG,CSR and ISR in Next.js?",
    answer:
      "SSR (Server-Side Rendering)\n\n\n\nSSR means the page is generated on the server every time a user requests it. The server runs the code, fetches the data, and returns a fully rendered HTML page for each request. It's great when your data changes frequently or you need fresh, real-time content—for example, dashboards, user profiles, or personalized pages.\n\n\n\nSSG (Static Site Generation)\n\n\n\nSSG means the page is generated once at build time, and the same pre-rendered HTML is served to every user. It's extremely fast because the page doesn't regenerate on each request. It works best for content that doesn't change often, like blogs, product pages, or marketing pages.\n\n\n\nISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)\n\n\n\nISR is like a mix of SSG and SSR. The page is generated at build time like SSG, but Next.js can update that page on the server after a set interval without rebuilding the entire project. So you get the speed of static pages with the ability to refresh data automatically. It's great for pages that update occasionally—like news updates, pricing pages, or product listings.\n\n\n\nCSR (Client-Side Rendering)\n\n\n\nThe page loads first, and then JavaScript fetches data on the client side.\n\nUsed for sections that don't need SEO or server rendering, like user dashboards after login.",

Data fetching happens using functions like getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, and getInitialProps. It's simple and familiar but has limited flexibility when it comes to layouts and server components.\n\n\n\nThe App Router is the newer system introduced in Next.js 13, using the app/ folder.\n\nIt's built around React Server Components and supports nested layouts, streaming, and more powerful data fetching using async components.

In plain React, everything runs on the client and we have to set up routing, data fetching, code splitting, and SEO handling manually. Next.js solves all of that out of the box.\n\n\n\nNext.js also improves performance because it can pre-render pages on the server, stream content, and optimize images automatically. It gives better SEO since pages load as HTML instead of waiting for JavaScript.

    answer:
      "React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast, interactive, and scalable user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture, which means the UI is split into reusable pieces called components. React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that change instead of reloading the whole page. It also supports one-way data flow, which makes applications predictable and easier to debug. React’s features like hooks, JSX, and reusable components help developers build modern, performance-optimized web applications.

      "React comes with several powerful features that make UI development fast and efficient. The biggest feature is its component-based architecture, which allows us to build UI using small, reusable components. React also uses the Virtual DOM, which helps improve performance by updating only the parts of the real DOM that actually change. It supports one-way data flow, making the application predictable and easier to debug. Another key feature is JSX, which lets us write HTML-like syntax directly inside JavaScript, improving readability. Finally, React offers hooks like useState, useEffect, and useMemo that allow functional components to manage state and side effects. These features together help build scalable, maintainable, and high-performance applications.",

      "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension in React that allows us to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript. JSX makes the UI code more readable and expressive because we can visually see the structure of the component. Behind the scenes, JSX is not HTML; it gets compiled into JavaScript functions like React.createElement. It also supports JavaScript expressions using curly braces, so we can dynamically render data. Overall, JSX makes building UI easier, cleaner, and more maintainable compared to writing large amounts of pure JavaScript.",

Normally, React components must return a single parent element, but with fragments we can group children without creating unnecessary <div> or <span> tags.

It allows you to show a fallback UI instead of breaking the app.\n\n🔵 Key Features of Error Boundaries:\n- Catch errors during rendering.\n- Catch errors in lifecycle methods.\n- Catch errors in constructors of child components.\n- Show a fallback UI gracefully.\n\n🟣 How to Create an Error Boundary:\nError boundaries must be class components because they rely on lifecycle methods.\n\nExample:\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n  }\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n    return { hasError: true };\n  }\n\n  componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n    console.log('Error:', error);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>;\n    }\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n\n🟡 Usage:\n<ErrorBoundary>\n  <MyComponent />\n</ErrorBoundary>\n\n🟠 Important Note:\n- Error boundaries do NOT catch errors from event handlers, async code, or server-side rendering.\n\nIn short: An Error Boundary prevents your React app from crashing by catching UI errors and showing a fallback UI.",

    answer:
      "React.memo and useMemo are both optimization tools in React, but they solve different problems.\n\nReact.memo is used to optimize whole components. It prevents a component from re-rendering if its props haven't changed. So it's mainly about avoiding unnecessary renders at the component level.\n\n\n\nuseMemo, on the other hand, is used inside a component to memoize a specific value or a heavy calculation. It only recomputes that value when its dependencies change. So it's not about preventing re-renders — it's about preventing expensive recalculations during a render",

      "DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface provided by the browser that represents a webpage as a tree of nodes. Every element—like div, button, or input—is a node in this tree. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to update or manipulate the UI dynamically. For example, changing text, adding elements, or removing elements all happen through the DOM. However, updating the real DOM frequently is slow because the browser must re-render layout, styling, and structure. That’s why libraries like React use a Virtual DOM to make updates faster. In simple words, DOM is the bridge between JavaScript and the UI on the screen.",

    question: "What is the Virtual DOM in React?",
    answer:
      "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. Instead of updating the actual browser DOM directly—which is slow—React first updates the Virtual DOM. After that, React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called diffing. Only the parts that changed are updated in the real DOM, not the entire page.

    answer: `A React class component has a defined lifecycle that describes how it is created, updated, and removed from the UI. The lifecycle is divided into three main phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

In the Mounting phase, the component is created and inserted into the DOM. Methods like constructor, render, and componentDidMount run here.

In the Updating phase, the component re-renders when state or props change. Methods like shouldComponentUpdate, render, and componentDidUpdate are called.

In the Unmounting phase, the component is removed from the DOM, and componentWillUnmount is used for cleanup tasks like removing event listeners.

    question: "How do you implement dynamic routing in Next.js?",
    answer:
      "In Next.js, dynamic routing is achieved using the [dynamic] tag in the page directory. For example, pages/posts/[id].tsx creates a dynamic route for posts/[id].\n\n When a user visits /posts/1, the page /posts/[id] is rendered with the id parameter set to 1. \n\n You can also create dynamic routes with multiple parameters, like pages/posts/[category]/[id].tsx. This allows you to create more complex routing patterns.\n\n You can use Nextjs useRouter hook from next/router to access the dynamic part of URL.\n\nExample: const router = useRouter(); const { id } = router.query;",

    answer:
      "Error Boundaries are special React components that catch JavaScript errors in the component tree during rendering, lifecycle methods, or inside child components. Instead of crashing the entire application, error boundaries display a fallback UI.\n\n🔵 Key Points:\n- They prevent the whole UI from breaking due to one component's error.\n- They catch errors during rendering, lifecycle methods, and inside children.\n- They do NOT catch errors in event handlers, async code, or server-side rendering.\n\n🔵 Example of Error Boundary:\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n  }\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError() {\n    return { hasError: true };\n  }\n\n  componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n    console.log(error, info);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return <h2>Something went wrong.</h2>;\n    }\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n\n🔵 Usage:\n<ErrorBoundary>\n  <MyComponent />\n</ErrorBoundary>\n\n🟡 Why Error Boundaries Are Useful:\n- Improve app stability.\n- Prevent full app crashes.\n- Provide better user experience by showing fallback UIs.\n\nIn short: Error Boundaries catch UI errors and show a fallback instead of breaking the entire app.",

    question: "What is React Fiber and Concurrent Mode?",
    answer:
      "React Fiber is the new rendering engine introduced in React 16. It changes how React updates the UI. Instead of doing all updates in one big process, Fiber breaks the work into smaller chunks. This allows React to pause, continue, or stop rendering when needed. Because of this, the UI stays smooth even when the app becomes heavy.\n\nConcurrent Mode is a set of features built on top of Fiber that makes React apps feel faster and more responsive. It allows React to prioritize important updates, like user input, over less important work. It also allows React to prepare multiple UI states in the background and update the screen only when ready.\n\nTogether:\n- Fiber improves how React schedules rendering.\n- Concurrent Mode uses Fiber to make rendering non-blocking and much smoother.\n\nIn simple words: Fiber is the engine that makes React faster and smarter, and Concurrent Mode is the feature that uses that engine to give users a smoother experience.",

In the App Router, you can check query parameters using the useSearchParams() hook in client components or the searchParams prop in server components. If a required parameter is missing or invalid, you can use the redirect() function from next/navigation to redirect the user to a fallback page, or use notFound() to show a 404 page. In client components, you can also render a friendly error message or fallback UI. Validating and handling query parameters proactively ensures better user experience and prevents unexpected errors.",

    question:
      "How can you share query parameters across multiple components efficiently?",
    answer:
      "To share query parameters across multiple components efficiently in Next.js, you can use a combination of React state or context with the useSearchParams() hook from next/navigation. For client components, you can read the parameters once using useSearchParams() and then provide them through a React Context or a state management solution like Redux or Zustand. This avoids reading the URL multiple times and ensures that all components have consistent access to the query data. In server components, you can pass the searchParams prop down to child components as props, allowing multiple components to access the parameters without repeatedly reading the URL.",

    question: "How can you update query parameters without reloading the page?",
    answer:
      "In Next.js App Router, you can update query parameters without reloading the page using the useRouter() hook from next/navigation. The router object provides methods like router.replace() or router.push() that let you modify the URL and query parameters client-side while staying on the same page. For example, calling router.push(`/profile?id=20&ref=google`) will update the URL and the page state without a full reload. This is useful for maintaining client-side state, filters, or pagination while providing a smooth user experience.",

    answer:
      "To sync UI state with URL query parameters in Next.js, you can use the useSearchParams() and useRouter() hooks from next/navigation in client components. First, read the current query parameters using useSearchParams() and initialize your UI state (like active tab or selected filter) based on these values. Then, whenever the UI state changes, update the URL using router.push() or router.replace() with the new query parameters. This approach keeps the UI in sync with the URL, allowing users to share or bookmark the current state without triggering a full page reload.",

  // Redux Questions
  {
    id: 156,
    question: "What is Redux and why do we use it?",
    answer:
      "Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications. It helps manage application state in a centralized store, making it easier to track changes and debug. Redux is commonly used in React applications when: \n1. Multiple components need to access the same state\n2. State needs to be shared across different parts of the application\n3. You need predictable state updates\n4. You want to implement features like undo/redo\n5. You need better debugging with tools like Redux DevTools\n\nRedux follows three core principles: single source of truth (one store), state is read-only (changes only through actions), and changes are made with pure functions (reducers).",
    category: "redux",
  },
  {
    id: 157,
    question: "What are the core principles of Redux?",
    answer:
      "Redux has three fundamental principles:\n\n1. Single Source of Truth: The entire application state is stored in a single object tree within a single store. This makes it easier to track changes and debug the application.\n\n2. State is Read-Only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither views nor network callbacks can directly modify the state.\n\n3. Changes are Made with Pure Functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers. Reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state without mutating the previous state.",
    category: "redux",
  },
  {
    id: 158,
    question: "What are Actions, Reducers, and Store in Redux?",
    answer:
      "Actions: Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in the application. They must have a 'type' property and can optionally include a payload with additional data. Example: { type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: { text: 'Learn Redux' } }\n\nReducers: Pure functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. They take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state. Example: (state = initialState, action) => { switch(action.type) { case 'ADD_TODO': return {...state, todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]} } }\n\nStore: The object that holds the entire application state. It has methods like getState() to access state, dispatch(action) to update state, and subscribe(listener) to register change listeners. Created using createStore(reducer).",

    question: "What is Redux Toolkit and why should we use it?",
    answer:
      "Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It was created to address common concerns about Redux being too complex and requiring too much boilerplate code.\n\nKey benefits:\n1. Simplifies store setup with configureStore()\n2.

    id: 160,
    question: "How do you handle async operations in Redux?",
    answer:
      "There are several ways to handle async operations in Redux:\n\n1. Redux Thunk (most common): Allows action creators to return functions instead of action objects. The function receives dispatch and getState as arguments.\nExample: const fetchUser = (id) => async (dispatch) => { dispatch({type: 'FETCH_START'}); const data = await api.getUser(id); dispatch({type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data}); }\n\n2. Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk: Simplifies async logic by automatically dispatching pending, fulfilled, and rejected actions.\nExample: const fetchUser = createAsyncThunk('users/fetch', async (userId) => { return await api.getUser(userId); })\n\n3. Redux Saga: Uses generator functions for complex async flows with better testability.\n\n4. Redux Observable: Uses RxJS observables for handling async operations with powerful operators.\n\nRedux Thunk and createAsyncThunk are the most commonly used approaches.",

    question: "What is the difference between Redux and Context API?",
    answer:
      "Redux and Context API both manage state Context API is great for small to medium applications where we need to share simple global data like theme, user info, or language. It avoids prop drilling but doesn’t offer advanced features. \n\n Redux, on the other hand, is a full state management library that provides predictable global state control using reducers, actions, and a centralized store. It’s better for large applications with complex state logic. Redux also provides tools like middleware, debugging, and time-travel debugging.",

  {
    id: 162,
    question: "What are Redux middleware and when would you use them?",
    answer:
      "Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer. Middleware can:\n- Intercept actions\n- Modify actions\n- Delay actions\n- Log actions\n- Make async calls\n- Dispatch additional actions\n\nCommon middleware:\n1. Redux Thunk: Handles async logic by allowing functions as actions\n2. Redux Saga: Handles complex async flows with generators\n3. Redux Logger: Logs every action and state change\n4. Redux Promise: Handles promises in actions\n\nExample use case: Authentication middleware that intercepts every action, checks if the user is authenticated, and redirects to login if not.\n\nMiddleware is applied when creating the store: const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk, logger))",

  {
    id: 163,
    question: "How does Redux DevTools help in debugging?",
    answer:
      "Redux DevTools is a powerful debugging tool that provides:\n\n1. Action History: See all dispatched actions in chronological order with their payloads\n2. State Inspection: View the entire state tree at any point in time\n3. Time Travel Debugging: Jump back and forth between different states by selecting actions\n4. Action Replay: Replay actions to reproduce bugs\n5. State Diff: See exactly what changed between states\n6. Action Dispatch: Manually dispatch actions for testing\n7. Export/Import: Save and load state snapshots for testing\n8. Performance Monitoring: Track performance of actions and renders\n\nTo enable it, install the browser extension and use configureStore() from Redux Toolkit (includes it by default) or add devTools enhancer to your store configuration. It's invaluable for understanding state changes and debugging complex state logic.",

    question: "What are selectors in Redux and why are they important?",
    answer:
      "Selectors are functions that extract specific pieces of data from the Redux store state. They encapsulate the logic for reading data from the store.\n\nBenefits:\n1. Encapsulation: Hide the state structure from components\n2. Reusability: Use the same selector in multiple components\n3. Memoization: With libraries like Reselect, selectors can cache results for better performance\n4. Testability: Easy to test independently of components\n5. Maintainability: If state structure changes, only update selectors\n\nExample:\nBasic selector: const selectTodos = (state) => state.todos\nMemoized selector with Reselect: const selectCompletedTodos = createSelector([selectTodos], (todos) => todos.filter(t => t.completed))\n\nUsage in component: const todos = useSelector(selectTodos)\n\nMemoized selectors only recalculate when their inputs change, preventing unnecessary renders and computations.",

    question: "What is Socket.IO and how does it differ from WebSockets?",
    answer:
      "Socket.IO is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. While it uses WebSocket as the underlying transport when possible, it has key differences:\n\nWebSocket:\n- Native browser API\n- Raw protocol for real-time communication\n- Requires manual implementation of features\n- Limited fallback options\n- Lower-level, more control\n\nSocket.IO:\n- Library built on top of WebSocket\n- Automatic reconnection\n- Built-in fallback (HTTP long-polling if WebSocket unavailable)\n- Room and namespace support\n- Automatic JSON parsing\n- Broadcast and event-based API\n- Works across all browsers and devices\n\nSocket.IO provides a higher-level abstraction with more features out of the box, making it easier to build production-ready real-time applications.

    question: "What is TypeScript and why should we use it?",
    answer:
      "TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations. In my experience working with both JavaScript and TypeScript projects, I've found several key advantages:\n\n1. Catch Bugs Early: Type checking catches issues during development, not in production. I've prevented countless runtime errors this way.\n\n2. Better Refactoring: When I need to rename a property or change a function signature, TypeScript shows me exactly what breaks.\n\n3. Improved Developer Experience: Autocomplete and IntelliSense make coding faster and reduce the need to constantly check documentation.\n\n4. Self-Documenting Code: Types serve as inline documentation, making it easier for team members to understand the codebase.\n\n5. Easier Maintenance: When returning to code after months, types help me understand what I wrote much faster.\n\nReal Example from my work:\n```typescript\n// This API call error would only show in production with JS\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\nasync function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User> {\n  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);\n  return response.json(); // TypeScript ensures return matches User interface\n}\n\n// TypeScript catches this at development time\nconst user = await fetchUser(123); // Error: number not assignable to string\n```\n\nIn my projects, TypeScript has reduced production bugs by about 40% and made onboarding new developers much smoother.",

I use them daily in API calls, React components, and utility functions.\n\nReal-world API example I use:\n```typescript\n// Generic API response handler\ninterface ApiResponse<T> {\n  data: T;\n  status: number;\n  message?: string;\n}\n\nasync function fetchData<T>(url: string): Promise<ApiResponse<T>> {\n  const response = await fetch(url);\n  return response.json();\n}\n\n// Type-safe usage\nconst users = await fetchData<User[]>('/api/users');\nconst product = await fetchData<Product>('/api/product/1');\n```\n\nGeneric React Component I created:\n```typescript\ninterface SelectProps<T> {\n  options: T[];\n  value: T;\n  onChange: (value: T) => void;\n  getLabel: (item: T) => string;\n}\n\nfunction Select<T>({ options, value, onChange, getLabel }: SelectProps<T>) {\n  return (\n    <select value={getLabel(value)} onChange={(e) => { /* ... */ }}>\n      {options.map(opt => <option key={getLabel(opt)}>{getLabel(opt)}</option>)}\n    </select>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nUtility function with constraints:\n```typescript\n// Only accept objects with an 'id' property\nfunction findById<T extends { id: string }>(items: T[], id: string): T | undefined {\n  return items.find(item => item.id === id);\n}\n\nconst user = findById(users, '123'); // Type-safe\n```\n\nThis approach has saved me from many runtime errors when working with different data types.",

    question: "What are TypeScript Utility Types?",
    answer:
      "Utility types are TypeScript's built-in helpers that I use constantly to transform types. Here are the ones I use most in my daily work:\n\n1. Partial<T> - For update functions:\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  age: number;\n}\n\n// Update only some fields\nfunction updateUser(id: string, updates: Partial<User>) {\n  // Can pass { name: 'John' } without other fields\n}\n```\n\n2. Pick<T, K> - For DTOs:\n```typescript\n// Only send specific fields to frontend\ntype UserDTO = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name' | 'email'>;\n```\n\n3. Omit<T, K> - For creating new entities:\n```typescript\n// Remove id when creating new user (DB generates it)\ntype CreateUserInput = Omit<User, 'id'>;\n```\n\n4. Record<K, T> - For maps and lookups:\n```typescript\n// Form validation errors\ntype ValidationErrors = Record<string, string>;\nconst errors: ValidationErrors = {\n  email: 'Invalid email',\n  password: 'Too short'\n};\n```\n\n5. ReturnType<T> - Extract function return types:\n```typescript\nfunction fetchUser() {\n  return { id: '1', name: 'John', role: 'admin' };\n}\n\ntype User = ReturnType<typeof fetchUser>;\n// No need to define interface separately!\n```\n\n6. Required<T> & Readonly<T>:\n```typescript\n// Config that can't be modified\ntype Config = Readonly<{\n  apiUrl: string;\n  timeout: number;\n}>;\n```\n\nThese have reduced boilerplate code significantly in my projects.",

    question:
      "What is the difference between 'any', 'unknown', and 'never' types?",
    answer:
      "These three types confused me initially, but after working with TypeScript for 3 years, here's how I use them:\n\nany - I avoid it unless absolutely necessary:\n```typescript\n// BAD - loses all type safety\nlet data: any = fetchSomeData();\ndata.something.that.doesnt.exist(); // No error until runtime!\n\n// Only use for quick prototyping or third-party libraries with no types\nconst thirdPartyLib: any = require('old-library');\n```\n\nunknown - My go-to for uncertain types:\n```typescript\n// GOOD - Forces type checking\nfunction processApiResponse(response: unknown) {\n  // Must check type before using\n  if (typeof response === 'object' && response !== null) {\n    if ('data' in response) {\n      return response.data;\n    }\n  }\n  throw new Error('Invalid response');\n}\n\n// I use this for try-catch blocks\ntry {\n  doSomething();\n} catch (error: unknown) {\n  if (error instanceof Error) {\n    console.log(error.message);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nnever - For exhaustive checks and errors:\n```typescript\n// Exhaustive type checking (super useful!)\ntype Status = 'pending' | 'success' | 'error';\n\nfunction handleStatus(status: Status) {\n  switch(status) {\n    case 'pending': return 'Loading...';\n    case 'success': return 'Done!';\n    case 'error': return 'Failed!';\n    default:\n      // If I add a new status, TypeScript errors here\n      const exhaustive: never = status;\n      return exhaustive;\n  }\n}\n\n// Functions that always throw\nfunction fail(message: string): never {\n  throw new Error(message);\n}\n```\n\nRule of thumb: unknown > any, always. Never is for special cases.",

    question: "Explain Type Guards in TypeScript",
    answer:
      "Type guards help narrow down types in conditional blocks. I use them constantly to handle different types safely.\n\n1. typeof - for primitives (most common):\n```typescript\nfunction formatValue(value: string | number) {\n  if (typeof value === 'string') {\n    return value.toUpperCase(); // TS knows it's string\n  }\n  return value.toFixed(2); // TS knows it's number\n}\n```\n\n2. instanceof - for classes:\n```typescript\nfunction handleError(error: Error | string) {\n  if (error instanceof Error) {\n    console.log(error.stack); // Safe access to Error properties\n  } else {\n    console.log(error); // It's a string\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. 'in' operator - for object properties:\n```typescript\ninterface ApiError {\n  errorCode: number;\n  message: string;\n}\n\ninterface ApiSuccess {\n  data: any;\n}\n\nfunction handleResponse(res: ApiError | ApiSuccess) {\n  if ('errorCode' in res) {\n    // Handle error\n    showError(res.message);\n  } else {\n    // Handle success\n    processData(res.data);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Custom type guards (my favorite for complex logic):\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  type: 'user';\n  name: string;\n}\n\ninterface Admin {\n  type: 'admin';\n  name: string;\n  permissions: string[];\n}\n\nfunction isAdmin(user: User | Admin): user is Admin {\n  return user.type === 'admin';\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction greet(user: User | Admin) {\n  if (isAdmin(user)) {\n    console.log(user.permissions); // Safe!\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5. Discriminated unions (best pattern for state management):\n```typescript\ntype LoadingState = { status: 'loading' };\ntype SuccessState = { status: 'success'; data: any };\ntype ErrorState = { status: 'error'; error: string };\n\ntype State = LoadingState | SuccessState | ErrorState;\n\nfunction render(state: State) {\n  switch (state.status) {\n    case 'loading':\n      return <Spinner />;\n    case 'success':\n      return <Data data={state.data} />; // TS knows data exists\n    case 'error':\n      return <Error message={state.error} />; // TS knows error exists\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI use discriminated unions for almost all state management in React apps.",

    question: "What are Union and Intersection types?",
    answer:
      "Union (|) and Intersection (&) types are fundamental to how I structure types in my projects.\n\nUnion (|) - 'OR' logic - value can be one of several types:\n```typescript\n// Common use case: API response\ntype ApiResponse = SuccessResponse | ErrorResponse;\n\n// Function parameters\nfunction setId(id: string | number) {\n  // id can be either\n}\n\n// Status flags\ntype Status = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error';\n\n// Real example from my work\ntype PaymentMethod = 'card' | 'paypal' | 'crypto';\n```\n\nIntersection (&) - 'AND' logic - combines multiple types:\n```typescript\n// Composing types\ninterface Timestamped {\n  createdAt: Date;\n  updatedAt: Date;\n}\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\n// User with timestamps\ntype UserEntity = User & Timestamped;\n\nconst user: UserEntity = {\n  id: '1',\n  name: 'John',\n  createdAt: new Date(),\n  updatedAt: new Date()\n};\n```\n\nReal-world pattern I use for permissions:\n```typescript\ninterface BaseUser {\n  id: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\ninterface AdminPermissions {\n  canDelete: boolean;\n  canBan: boolean;\n}\n\ninterface ModeratorPermissions {\n  canEdit: boolean;\n  canApprove: boolean;\n}\n\n// Admin has all user properties + admin permissions\ntype Admin = BaseUser & AdminPermissions;\n\n// User can be regular, moderator, or admin\ntype User = BaseUser | (BaseUser & ModeratorPermissions) | Admin;\n```\n\nExtending third-party types (very useful!):\n```typescript\nimport { Request } from 'express';\n\ninterface AuthData {\n  userId: string;\n  role: string;\n}\n\n// Add auth data to Express Request\ntype AuthRequest = Request & { auth: AuthData };\n```\n\nSimple rule: Use | when value can be different things, use & when you want to merge types together.",

    question: "What are TypeScript Decorators and how do they work?",
    answer:
      "Decorators are a powerful feature I've used mainly in Angular and NestJS projects. They're functions that modify classes, methods, or properties at design time.\n\nNote: Need 'experimentalDecorators': true in tsconfig.json\n\nMost common use case - API endpoints (NestJS):\n```typescript\n@Controller('users')\nexport class UserController {\n  @Get(':id')\n  @UseGuards(AuthGuard)\n  async getUser(@Param('id') id: string) {\n    return this.userService.findOne(id);\n  }\n  \n  @Post()\n  @HttpCode(201)\n  createUser(@Body() createUserDto: CreateUserDto) {\n    return this.userService.create(createUserDto);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMethod decorator for logging (I created this for debugging):\n```typescript\nfunction LogExecutionTime() {\n  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {\n    const originalMethod = descriptor.value;\n    \n    descriptor.value = async function (...args: any[]) {\n      const start = Date.now();\n      const result = await originalMethod.apply(this, args);\n      const end = Date.now();\n      console.log(`${propertyKey} took ${end - start}ms`);\n      return result;\n    };\n    \n    return descriptor;\n  };\n}\n\nclass DataService {\n  @LogExecutionTime()\n  async fetchData() {\n    // expensive operation\n  }\n}\n```\n\nValidation decorator pattern:\n```typescript\nfunction ValidateEmail() {\n  return function (target: any, propertyKey: string) {\n    let value: string;\n    \n    const getter = () => value;\n    const setter = (newVal: string) => {\n      if (!newVal.includes('@')) {\n        throw new Error('Invalid email');\n      }\n      value = newVal;\n    };\n    \n    Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, {\n      get: getter,\n      set: setter\n    });\n  };\n}\n\nclass User {\n  @ValidateEmail()\n  email: string;\n}\n```\n\nHonestly, I don't write custom decorators often - mostly use framework-provided ones (Angular's @Component, @Injectable, NestJS's @Controller, @Get, etc.). They're powerful but can make code harder to understand if overused.",

Async Error Handling:\n```typescript\nasync function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User> {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);\n    if (!response.ok) {\n      throw new NetworkError(response.status, 'Failed to fetch user');\n    }\n    return await response.json();\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error instanceof NetworkError) {\n      console.error(`Network error: ${error.statusCode}`);\n    }\n    throw error;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5. Error Boundaries (React):\n```typescript\ninterface Props { children: React.ReactNode; }\ninterface State { hasError: boolean; error?: Error; }\n\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<Props, State> {\n  state: State = { hasError: false };\n  \n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {\n    return { hasError: true, error };\n  }\n  \n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return <div>Error: {this.state.error?.message}</div>;\n    }\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n```",

    question: "What is Type Assertion and when should you use it?",
    answer:
      "Type Assertion tells TypeScript to treat a value as a specific type. It's like type casting but doesn't perform runtime checks.\n\nSyntax (Two Ways):\n```typescript\n// Angle-bracket syntax\nlet value: any = 'hello';\nlet length1 = (<string>value).length;\n\n// 'as' syntax (preferred, works with JSX)\nlet length2 = (value as string).length;\n```\n\nCommon Use Cases:\n\n1. DOM Manipulation:\n```typescript\nconst input = document.getElementById('email') as HTMLInputElement;\ninput.value = 'test@example.com';\n\n// Or with null check\nconst input = document.getElementById('email');\nif (input instanceof HTMLInputElement) {\n  input.value = 'test@example.com';\n}\n```\n\n2. API Responses:\n```typescript\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n}\n\nconst response = await fetch('/api/user');\nconst user = await response.json() as User;\n```\n\n3. Type Narrowing:\n```typescript\ninterface Cat { meow: () => void; }\ninterface Dog { bark: () => void; }\n\nfunction makeSound(animal: Cat | Dog) {\n  if ('meow' in animal) {\n    (animal as Cat).meow();\n  } else {\n    (animal as Dog).bark();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Const Assertions:\n```typescript\nconst config = {\n  apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',\n  timeout: 5000\n} as const; // readonly properties, literal types\n```\n\n5. Non-null Assertion (!):\n```typescript\nfunction getValue(key: string): string | null {\n  return localStorage.getItem(key);\n}\n\n// When you're certain it's not null\nconst token = getValue('authToken')!;\n```\n\nDouble Assertion (Escape Hatch):\n```typescript\n// TypeScript won't allow incompatible assertions\nconst x = 'hello' as number; // Error\n\n// But you can force it (not recommended)\nconst y = ('hello' as any) as number; // OK, but dangerous\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n- Use sparingly; prefer type guards\n- Prefer 'as' syntax over angle brackets\n- Avoid 'as any' unless absolutely necessary\n- Use ! operator only when you're certain value exists\n- Consider type guards for better type safety",
